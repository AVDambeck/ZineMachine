# Make Zines Easy!
This is a tool to pageset zines using HTML as it's markup language. Forked from [@rowan_m](https://twitter.com/rowan_m)'s site [/zine-machine.glitch.me](https://zine-machine.glitch.me/).




# Usage
The img directory contains img-0.png through img-8.png. These are your eight pages. Included as an example is my game [Robots](https://github.com/AVDambeck/Robots). Any images should work, but included is an [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org) command to split pdfs into a png for each page. 

Simply download the repository and put it somewhere connivent. Put your pages in img, and then open index.html in your browser. Press print and there you go. You can print it to a pdf if you want to send copies that way, or send it straight to your printer.

If you want to remove the borders, simply comment or delete lines 15 and 16 in master.css. 

I'm printing on letter paper. I suspect that if you had your zine pages proportioned to ISO standards, that it would just work with A4. If not you can tweak the css for it.
